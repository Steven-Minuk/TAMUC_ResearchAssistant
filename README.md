# TAMUC_ResearchAssistant

I have been working as a Research Assistant in the Computer Science Department at Texas A&M University-Commerce since September 2023.

From September 2023 to August 2024, I worked under Dr.Omar El Ariss, handling course materials for COSC 1436(Fundamental Programming 1) and COSC 1437(Fundamental Programming 2). During this session, individually, I developed Arcade PingPong & Maze games with Python. Also, I developed the Mortal Kombat game using Python & Java with Professor Omar El Ariss for COSC 1436 & COSC 1437 courses.

Since September 2024, I have been working under Dr.Jinoh Kim and Dr.Dongeun Lee with 2 graduate students by researching NTPP(Neural Temporal Point Processes) using Machine Learning. Especially, I am in charge of Pre-Processing the data which will be used for machine learning. 

Personal Project Folder:

Personally, I made Maze Game and Arcade PingPong games with Python by using Mu Editor. In the Mu Editor, there is a PygameZero module, so I didn't need to download or import the module. In other words, there is no source code for importing the PygameZero module, so it won't be working on regular Python Editor like VSCode or Pycharm. I recommend using 'Mu Editor' with the PygameZero Mode. I put the website address below.
